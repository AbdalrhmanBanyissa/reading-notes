##### What is **Script** ?
We have learned that scripts are a set of concepts, commands and instructions that we assign to the computer in order to achieve the goal that we seek from these instructions, but in order to achieve this, the user must use a programming language because the computer does not understand human language.

When writing the script, it is preferable to specify the goal of the program that we are writing, and then we write this program in a smooth and sequential manner, each step or each command separately, so that we do not get into the maze of programming errors and it is sometimes possible to rewrite the program, which is really cumbersome.

#### What is **Javascript** ?
JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.

## Expressions & Operators
An **expression** is any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a value. there are two types of expressions:

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
    ```java scipt
    var color = 'beige';
    ```
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
    ```java scipt
    var area = 3 * 2;
    ```

An **Operator** performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result.

* ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
    ```java script
    color = 'beige';
    ```
* ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
    ```java script
    area = 3 * 2;
    ```
* STRING OPERATORS
    ```java script
    greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';
    ```
* COMPARISON OPERATORS
    ```java script
    buy = 3 > 5;
    ```
* LOGICAL OPERATORS
    ```java script
    buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);
    ```

## Functions
**Function** is like a big box can hold many lines of code to perform a specific task. and you can use it in more than on place of your program.

#### Syntax
```java script
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
```
