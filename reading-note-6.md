### Comparison operators
We use **comparison operators** to evaluating conditions and the result of the compareson operator will be booliean value *(true / false)*. Usually comparison operators return a single value.



#### Basic structure 

`score >= Pass` 
, Which: 
* score: operand
* '>=': operator
* pass: operand

 ### Logical operators
 **logical operators** allowes us to use two or more compareson operators together in one sentence and return the final value as a *true or false*.

 #### Basic structure 

 ` 5<2 && 2>=3 ` 
 , Which:
 * 2, 3, and 5 are operands
 * && logical operator
 * '>=, <' compareson operators

## Loops

### For loop
**For loop** use the counter as a condition and it has a very specific number of iterations.

 #### Basic structure 

 ```java script
 for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
* Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

* Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

* Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

### While loop
**While Loop** can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

 #### Basic structure 

 ```java script
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed

}
```
