# Introduction to **websites**

## html 5 ![html5 logo](https://catalin.red/dist/uploads/2011/01/css3-html5-logo-initial.png)

To open a **websites** you need this basic parameter:

* Browsers: People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.


* Web Servers: When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website.


* Devices: People are accessing websites
on an increasing range of devices
including desktop computers,
laptops, tablets, and mobile
phones.


* Screen readers: Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.

***Note***

>All websites use HTML and CSS, but content
management systems, blogging software, and
e-commerce platforms often add a few more
technologies into the mix.

## Extra markup

1. comments: If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser.

    <!-- start of main text -->
    <p>Olafur Eliasson was born in Copenhagen, Denmark
    in 1967 to Icelandic parents.</p>
    <p>He is known for sculptures and large-scale
    installation art employing elemental materials
    such as light, water, and air temperature to
    enhance the viewer's experience.</p>
    <!-- end of main text -->

2. ID attribute: It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page.

    <p id="pullquote">Every time I view the sea I feel
    a calming sense of security, as if visiting my
    ancestral home; I embark on a voyage of seeing.
    </p>

3. Class attribute: identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.

    <p class="important">For a one-year period from
    November 2010, the Marugame Genichiro-Inokuma
    Museum of Contemporary Art (MIMOCA) will host a
    cycle of four Hiroshi Sugimoto exhibitions.</p>
    <p>Each will showcase works by the artist
    thematically contextualized under the headings
    "Science," "Architecture," "History" and
    "Religion" so as to present a comprehensive
    panorama of the artist's oeuvre.</p>
    <p class="important admittance">Hours: 10:00 â€“ 18:00
    (No admittance after 17:30)</p>


4. block elements: Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.

## Layouts


**Layouts** is basically introducing a set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

We can name the layout as a common layout (that a lot of web pages used) when it contains header that have logo and navigation bar, and a bunch of articles below the header and finally a footer.

As we mentioned before we starts **HTML** structure with a *DOCTYPE*  and that is because here are several versions of HTML.

There are a lot of elements in **HTML** that help us coding our webpage to make the user more easy to read and to make aesthetics like `<div>`, `<span>` and so on.


## Website Design

When you design a website you should ask these questions:

* Who is the Site For?
* Why People Visit Your Website?
* What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
* What Information Your Visitors Need?
* How Of ten People Will Visit Your Site?

So when you design a website you should draw a websit map and build your wire frame to know exactly what are you designing and building.

## JavaScript ![JavaScript logo](https://geeksgod.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/js-logo.jpg)

##### What is **Script** ?
We have learned that scripts are a set of concepts, commands and instructions that we assign to the computer in order to achieve the goal that we seek from these instructions, but in order to achieve this, the user must use a programming language because the computer does not understand human language.

When writing the script, it is preferable to specify the goal of the program that we are writing, and then we write this program in a smooth and sequential manner, each step or each command separately, so that we do not get into the maze of programming errors and it is sometimes possible to rewrite the program, which is really cumbersome.

#### What is **Javascript** ?
JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.
