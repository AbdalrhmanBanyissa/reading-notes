The text editor is a software you can download in your own machine computer and use it for manage a text or build a website.
In fact if you ask me what is the best text editor to deal with it my answer will be ask china!! ( which mean I dont know actually) 
because there is a bunch of text editors out there and every one who uses them are uses the software which he like it or love it or be comfortable dealing with it
so the best text editor is what you like, the are all the same approximately. 
As we mentioned text editors are all do the same job but they are defferent in features, some of them has useful features
as  code completion , syntax and highlighting and some of them are not.
so as I told you use the text editor that you feel comfortable with it and go for it.
