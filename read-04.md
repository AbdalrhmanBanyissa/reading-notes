# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## HTML Links

A link has two ends and a direction. The link starts at the "source" anchor and points to the "destination" anchor, which may be any Web resource (e.g., an image, a video clip, a sound bite, a program, an HTML document, an element within an HTML document, etc.).

>Links Tags

* `<a></a>`  define a link

* `href` define the link address

* ` target ` define where to open the linked document

* `mailto` create a link that opens the user's email program

## JS Functions

Functions is like a big box can hold many lines of code to perform a specific task. and you can use it in more than on place of your program.

All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects

> primitive value

A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

* ` number `

## CSS Layout

Layouts is basically introducing a set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

We can name the layout as a common layout (that a lot of web pages used) when it contains header that have logo and navigation bar, and a bunch of articles below the header and finally a footer.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. What if you can could get all of this, instantaneously, while typing code line by line and character by character? You can, with pair programming, a technique common to many agile work environments.

More “two heads are better than one” than “stop reading over my shoulder,” pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. At Code Fellows, pair programing is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills.

> Why pair program?

1. Greater efficiency


2. Engaged collaboration


3. Learning from fellow students


4. Social skills


5. Job interview readiness


6. Work environment readiness
