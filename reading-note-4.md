# HTML
`HTML` **(HyperText Markup Language)** is the basic building block of the Web pages and It defines the meaning and structure of web content.

With `HTML` you can add text documents and photos to your web pages in a basic form which mean without formatting.

HTML uses something calling tags and attributes which are a set of characters and symbols located between angle brackets to give a special meaning to their contents.

Tags in HTML comes in pairs; 
opening tags ` <p> `  and closing tags ` </p> `

Every HTML webpage have this basic structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
and to organize our web pages we use something called layout which that we tells `HTML` to write all the documentation in a proper way, then we use `CSS` to add some makeup and good looking to the webpage.
