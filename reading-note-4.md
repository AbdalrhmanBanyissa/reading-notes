**HTML** *(HyperText Markup Language)* is the basic building block of the Web pages and It defines the meaning and structure of web content.

With **HTML** you can add text documents and photos to your web pages in a basic form which mean without formatting.

HTML uses something calling tags and attributes which are a set of characters and symbols located between angle brackets to give a special meaning to their contents.

Tags in HTML comes in pairs 
  * opening tags ` <p> `  
  * closing tags ` </p> `

### Every HTML webpage have this basic structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
and to organize our web pages we use something called layout which that we tells **HTML** to write all the documentation in a proper way, then we use **CSS** to add some makeup and good looking to the webpage.

**Layouts** is basically introducing a set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

We can name the layout as a common layout (that a lot of web pages used) when it contains header that have logo and navigation bar, and a bunch of articles below the header and finally a footer.

As we mentioned before we starts **HTML** structure with a *DOCTYPE*  and that is because here are several versions of HTML.

There are a lot of elements in **HTML** that help us coding our webpage to make the user more easy to read and to make aesthetics like `<div>`, `<span>` and so on.
