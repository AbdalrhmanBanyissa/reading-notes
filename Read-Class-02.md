## React: Component Lifecycle Events

Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting are the three phases of the component lifecycle.

* Mounting
When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

* Updating
Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered.

* Unmounting
The final phase of the lifecycle if called when a component is being removed from the DOM.

* The constructor for a React component is called before it is mounted.


* Render is the only required method in a class component. It will examine this.props and this.state when called.

## React Bootstrap

* The most popular front-end framework
Rebuilt for React.

* React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.
