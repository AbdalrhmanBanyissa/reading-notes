## How I explained REST to my brother

Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet. His name is on the specification for HTTP - the protocol used to get pages from servers to your browser.

- HTTP tells the browser what protocol to use.

- The world wide web is built on an architectural style called "REST" - which provides a definition of a "resource"

- URL is machine equivalent of a noun

- Polymorphism - different nounds can have the same verb applied to them.

- You can't apply the same verb to every noun: drive a cup, drink a car

- HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns.

  - When you go to a webpage the browser does an HTTP GET on the url you type in and retrieves a web page

- HTTP is not just to GET things
