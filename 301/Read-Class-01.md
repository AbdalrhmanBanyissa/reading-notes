## What is a component?

* A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

* A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

* A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

## What are the charactistics of a component?

1. Reusability

2. Replaceable

3. Not context specific

4. Extensible

5. Encapsulated

6. Independent

## What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

* Ease of deployment

* Reduced cost

* Ease of development

* Reusable

* Modification of technical complexity

* Reliability

* System maintenance and evolution

* Independent

## What is props short for?

“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)

## How are props used in React?

1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)

2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props

3. Finally, render the Props Data

## What is the flow of props?

Props can only be passed to components in one-way (parent to child)

## Things I want to know more about

I will leave this section now and come back after tomorrow class because I feel I didn't understand everything is well from reading.
