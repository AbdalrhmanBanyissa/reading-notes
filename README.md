## **Growth mindset**

I believe a growth mindset makes people more creative and more positive, because we all know that the more you train your mind to think in this way, the more growth mindset you get.

in my opinion I think that growth mindset is that you are taking your abilities and knowlage and put these all on the right place throug traning your self and your mind that you always can do that.

### **For me, I rely primarily on these three key points for my mental development:**

#### *Adaptability:*
>I can interact with different cultures, try to immerse themselves in them, cope with different circumstances, and try to always be positive

#### *Continuous Improvement:* 
>I strive to improve myself in a subtle and permanent way and to move from the best to the best

#### *Ambition and initiative:* 
>My ambition literally has no limits, and in my nature I will be among the first initiators.
